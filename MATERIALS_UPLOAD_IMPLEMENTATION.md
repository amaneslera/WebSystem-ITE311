### Status: **WORKING** ✓

---

## 📋 Implementation Steps Completed

### ✅ Step 1: Database Migration
- **File**: `app/Database/Migrations/2025-10-14-032842_CreateMaterialsTable.php`
- **Status**: Migrated successfully
- **Table Structure**:
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE materials (
    id INT(11) UNSIGNED AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    course_id INT(11) UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
    file_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    file_path VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (course_id) REFERENCES courses(id) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
  );
  ```

### ✅ Step 2: Material Model
- **File**: `app/Models/MaterialModel.php`
- **Methods**:
  - `insertMaterial($data)` - Insert new material
  - `getMaterialsByCourse($course_id)` - Get materials by course ID
- **Features**: Error handling with try-catch

### ✅ Step 3: Materials Controller
- **File**: `app/Controllers/Materials.php`
- **Methods**:
  - `upload($course_id)` - Handle file upload with validation
  - `delete($material_id)` - Delete material and file
  - `download($material_id)` - Secure download with enrollment check
- **Security**: Enrollment verification, file validation

### ✅ Step 4: File Upload Implementation
- **Upload Path**: `writable/uploads/materials/`
- **Validation Rules**:
  - Max file size: 10MB
  - Allowed types: pdf, doc, docx, ppt, pptx, zip, rar, jpg, jpeg, png
- **File Naming**: Random names for security
- **Database Path**: Relative path (`writable/uploads/materials/filename.ext`)

### ✅ Step 5: Upload View
- **File**: `app/Views/materials/upload.php`
- **Features**:
  - Bootstrap 5.3.3 styling
  - Form with `enctype="multipart/form-data"`
  - Flash message display (success/error)
  - Dismissible alerts

### ✅ Step 6: Student Dashboard Materials Display
- **File**: `app/Views/auth/dashboard.php` (Student section)
- **Features**:
  - Shows materials from enrolled courses
  - Download buttons for each material
  - Empty state message
- **Controller**: `app/Controllers/Auth.php` (dashboard method)

### ✅ Step 7: Download Method with Security
- **Enrollment Check**: Verifies user is enrolled in course
- **File Path Handling**: Supports both absolute and relative paths
- **Error Messages**: Clear feedback for missing files

### ✅ Step 8: Routes Configuration
- **File**: `app/Config/Routes.php`
- **Routes**:
  ```php
  $routes->get('/admin/course/(:num)/upload', 'Materials::upload/$1');
  $routes->post('/admin/course/(:num)/upload', 'Materials::upload/$1');
  $routes->get('/teacher/course/(:num)/upload', 'Materials::upload/$1');
  $routes->post('/teacher/course/(:num)/upload', 'Materials::upload/$1');
  $routes->get('/materials/upload/(:num)', 'Materials::upload/$1');
  $routes->post('/materials/upload/(:num)', 'Materials::upload/$1');
  $routes->get('/materials/delete/(:num)', 'Materials::delete/$1');
  $routes->get('/materials/download/(:num)', 'Materials::download/$1');
  ```

### ✅ Step 9: Testing Complete
- Upload tested ✓
- Database insert verified ✓
- File storage confirmed ✓
- Student download tested ✓
- Access restriction working ✓

## 🐛 Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: Missing Directory
- **Problem**: `writable/uploads/materials/` didn't exist
- **Solution**: Created directory with proper permissions
- **Result**: Files now upload successfully

### Issue 2: Method Comparison Case Sensitivity
- **Problem**: `$this->request->getMethod()` returns "POST" (uppercase) but code checked for "post" (lowercase)
- **Solution**: Changed to `strtolower($this->request->getMethod()) === 'post'`
- **Result**: POST requests now properly detected

### Issue 3: File Path Format
- **Problem**: Using absolute path broke download
- **Solution**: Changed to relative path: `writable/uploads/materials/filename.ext`
- **Result**: Consistent with existing records, downloads work

### Issue 4: Flash Messages Not Showing
- **Problem**: Used `redirect()->back()` which wasn't reliable
- **Solution**: Changed to `redirect()->to('/materials/upload/' . $course_id)` with explicit path
- **Result**: Flash messages now display correctly
